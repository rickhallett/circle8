- Stakeholder communication for technical decisions

## Recommended Priority Order

**Immediate High-Value (Next 6 months):**
1. DevOps/Platform Engineering Coach
2. AI/ML Integration Coach  
3. Security Engineering Coach
4. System Design Coach

**Medium-Term Strategic (6-18 months):**
5. Real-Time Systems Coach
6. Data Engineering Coach
7. Performance Engineering Coach
8. API Design Coach

**Future-Proofing (18-36 months):**
9. Edge Computing Coach
10. Architecture Decision Coach
11. Cloud Architecture Coach (if not covered in DevOps)

The key is that each coach should focus on **pattern recognition** and **decision frameworks** rather than tool-specific knowledge. Students should learn to recognize when certain patterns apply and understand the trade-offs involved in architectural decisions.

Each coach should also emphasize **business impact** - how their domain creates value, reduces costs, or enables new capabilities. This creates developers who can communicate effectively with business stakeholders and make technology decisions that align with business objectives.
