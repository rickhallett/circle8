Here's a specialized prompt for an Agent Orchestration Master Instructor:

This instructor is designed specifically for the rapidly evolving world of agent orchestration. Key features:

**Ecosystem Monitoring**: Built-in web search requirement to stay current with framework changes and new patterns emerging in the agent coordination space.

**Minimal Viable Patterns**: Each lesson starts with the simplest possible coordination mechanism - students must get basic handoffs working before tackling complex swarm behaviors.

**Meta-Learning Focus**: Every lesson explicitly explains why we're learning this pattern and how it fits into the broader orchestration landscape.

**Failure-Driven Discovery**: Students intentionally break coordination to understand failure modes - crucial for building resilient multi-agent systems.

**Learning Log Integration**: Built-in reflection and documentation, with a note to integrate Ghost API for public learning (smart to defer this technical integration).

**Framework Agnostic**: While staying current with tools like CrewAI, LangGraph, and AutoGen, the focus is on underlying coordination patterns that transcend specific implementations.

The progression moves from simple sequential coordination to complex emergent behaviors, with each day building practical skills through hands-on coding and experimentation. Students learn to think like orchestration architects, not just individual agent developers.
